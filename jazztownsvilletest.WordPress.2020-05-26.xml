<p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>...or something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>Development of jazz clubs in Townsville</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>HARBOUR END JAZZ CLUB</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst jazz music had been played in Townsville long before the Harbour End Jazz Club was formed in 1980, there had not been a recognised venue where jazz was performed for about twenty years. &nbsp;This club effectively started the revival of the jazz scene in Townsville which was then carried on with the formation of the North Queensland Jazz Club (NQ Jazz Club Inc. from 1995) and its subsequent change of name to Townsville Jazz Club Inc. in 2012.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Harbour End Jazz Club was started in 1980 by Mo Murakami, Ted Redknap, Bob Hebden and Les Nicholson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ted and Mo were members of the widely acclaimed North Qld Area Army Band. &nbsp;The Army band had a close association with the local musicians and having Ted and Mo as Directors cemented that close relationship. &nbsp;Mo also had an input into starting the NQ Jazz Club which still exists today and is a significant institution in the promotion of jazz in Townsville. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club met on every second Thursday at the then Tattersalls Hotel (Tatts) in a back room that was small but very intimate, the ideal jazz club. &nbsp;Crowds were phenomenal and there was not enough room to raise your arm to drink your beer. &nbsp;The room spilled out to a beer garden which thankfully provided some space. &nbsp;Brian Fitzimmons and his wife Pat ran Tatts and were very supportive of the club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian and Pat also ran jazz in the beer garden on Saturday afternoons which provided work for the local bands. &nbsp;Great musos such as Billy Laut, Ross Collins, Kanga Yoman and Franz Condie were regulars. &nbsp;<br>All were ex Sydney musos who had come north to get away from the rat race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going to the jazz club at Tatts was always a great night. &nbsp;The club became a place to be on the social scene and many friendships were formed which have lasted for 30 plus years. &nbsp;Over its life the club had some famous Australian musicians who appeared including the Bob Barnard Jazz Band which included John Macarthy, Chris Tapperel, Johnny Costello, Len Barnard and Whally Wickham. &nbsp;Don Burrows also played at the club as did Nth Qld legends like Junior See Poy and his wife Ann and Paul Zammit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club ran for many years and held two major Jazz Festivals in 1981 and 1983. &nbsp;Sheila Keefe, a then Townsville City Council Alderman, was instrumental in assisting with the 1983 festival and was the patron of the club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band (PMJB) was the house band at the club which in those days had a line-up of Ivan Hauri (clarinet), Luke Portier (bass), John Ruffle (piano), Bob Hebden (drums), Nev Minon (trombone) and Les Nicholson (trumpet). &nbsp;Paul Waters on clarinet was also a member of PMJB at various stages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the 23rd &nbsp;February 2014 PMJB celebrated its 40th birthday at the Townsville Jazz Club and at that time Les, Bob, John and Nev were still current band members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club folded in 1990 due to several factors, arguably the most significant being the demise of the Nth Qld Area Army Band. &nbsp;This decision by the Government of the time was very contentious and caused a vociferous outcry from members of the Townsville Community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For ten years the Harbour End Jazz Club was one of the ‘in’ places in the Townsville music scene and made a great contribution to the Townsville Arts and Music Community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>NQ JAZZ CLUB INC.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The formation of the North Queensland Jazz Club began with discussions led by Brian Linforth, Mo Murakami and Andrew Dajski around 1993. &nbsp;By 1994 these guys were playing once a month for ‘beer money’ just to get the club started however the club Newsletter from 1999 states that on Sunday 11th&nbsp;April the club celebrated its fourth birthday and indicates the official start of North Queensland Jazz Club being 7th&nbsp;April 1995. &nbsp;Bands appearing in this formative era included Andrew’s band&nbsp;<em>Downtown Dixie</em>, Nobby Nielsen from Cairns, Les Nicholson’s&nbsp;<em>Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band</em>&nbsp;and other groups of musos who regularly played together in un-named bands<em>.</em>&nbsp;Brian Linforth was the inaugural President and the club became incorporated on the 22nd&nbsp;July 1997 and adopted the official name of NQ Jazz Club Inc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original logo for the NQ Jazz Club Inc. was designed and drawn by Bob Hebden and depicted a trumpet-playing, bowler-hatted face in the sun overlooking Castle Hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":8,"width":299,"height":222,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="http://jazztownsville.test/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wp79efd882_05_06.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8" width="299" height="222"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In April 1998 three foundation members, Andrew Dajski, Brian Linforth and Mo Murakami (now deceased) were appointed as Life Members of the club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1998 was also the year that the NQ Jazz Club fully supported the decision by a small independent group, Les Nicholson, Bob Passmore, Peter Martin and Brian Lane (then president of the NQ Jazz Club), that the time was right to run an activity to encourage high school students to appreciate and play jazz. &nbsp;Whilst this was not a jazz club event Nth Qld Junior Jazz Festival Inc. was promoted through the NQ Jazz Club until the final festival was held in 2007 and the remaining funds were transferred to the NQ Jazz Club on the 25th&nbsp;June 2008. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like many other jazz clubs it was a struggle to find an appropriate venue and the first gig to gauge public interest was held in the Sovereign Hotel in Flinders Street. &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next four years the club’s jazz nights were held in the Exchange Hotel, The Crown Hotel, the Royal Hotel, the Rugby League Club in Redpath Street and then the Kirwan Function Centre until September 1998.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NQ Jazz Club then moved to its first ideal venue, the German Australian Club in Aitken Street, Aitkenvale on 25th&nbsp;October 1998 where it stayed until the building was put on the market December 2008. &nbsp;The committee could not be assured of having secure accommodation for the full year so another venue had to be found. &nbsp;The club moved to its current location at the Townsville PCYC, Wellington Street, Aitkenvale for the start of the 2009 year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club would not have become established and continued to operate had it not been for many dedicated voluntary committee members who gave their time freely to help manage a successful jazz club. &nbsp;Whilst it’s not possible to name all committee members club records show the following people have filled the President’s role since the first AGM in 1995:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1995 – 1996 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Linforth</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Len Kingsun</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1998 – 1999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Lane</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1999 – 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil Walsh</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2010 – 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marie Gibson</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2016 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corralie Costigan<br>2017 -&nbsp;&nbsp;2018 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken Burnes<br>2018 -&nbsp;&nbsp;2019 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry Thomson<br>2019 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Passmore</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2006 Albert Schimmel started a website to promote jazz music featuring the Jazz Program on 4TTT Radio and the NQ Jazz Club. &nbsp;This website is still being managed by Albert with regular updates to the Program page and a selection of photos taken at almost every jazz night each year. &nbsp;This facility has continued to be a great promotional tool for the club with traffic increasing every year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The committee of 2008 introduced some ‘feature’ nights to give members a selling point to entice new people to attend in an effort to increase attendance numbers that had been dwindling for a few years. &nbsp;The first of these special evenings would be held close to ANZAC Day featuring music from the war era and a jazz ball with Stokes Nicholson Big Band as the drawcard. &nbsp;Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band offered to present the ANZAC-themed night and a very successful&nbsp;<em>Come in Spinner</em>&nbsp;night with 93 attending was held on 27th&nbsp;April. &nbsp;<em>Cinderella’s Jazz Ball</em>&nbsp;was held on 13th&nbsp;September, the name reflecting that this was a mini-ball and guests would all be home before midnight! &nbsp;This was a way to hold a shorter-duration ball at a lower, more competitive ticket price than other balls then being held in Townsville. &nbsp;The night was a huge success with 103 people in attendance!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until this year a different band played at each jazz gig but as musicians moved away from Townsville, drifted to other more lucrative styles of music or retired from playing in bands the club constantly struggled to set a program in advance, not knowing which band would be available. This was not popular with patrons as the club had some members who liked to follow their preferred style of jazz or ‘their’ band and this uncertainty further depleted crowd numbers. &nbsp;In April the committee decided to introduce the stability of having the same band play on one of the two jazz nights each month and rotate bands in the other jazz night of each month. &nbsp;Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band was appointed as the first ‘house band’ and a new program had other bands playing on the 2nd&nbsp;Sunday of the month and PMJB regularly on the 4th&nbsp;Sunday. &nbsp;This greatly relieved the pressure on the committee, enabled program information to be publicised in advance through the monthly newsletter and attendances began to increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the change of venue in 2009 the club made a concerted effort to attract a wider circle of people to the club, predominantly by encouraging all members to introduce at least two new people to the club in that year. This was another successful attempt by the committee to revive the jazz club and with provided the momentum for other ventures such as the Step OUT-Step UP program designed to give emerging jazz enthusiasts the training and mentorship to step out of the classroom and up onto the stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club continued to hold an annual jazz ball with a change of title to Jazz ‘n Jewels Ball (later changed to Jazz &amp; Jewels Ball) giving patrons the opportunity to dress in their finery and skim the dance floor to the beautiful music of the 22-piece Stokes Nicholson Big Band and a special night close to ANZAC Day to commemorate the post-war era of jazz.</p>

<p>The Townsville Jazz Club was originally established as the NQ Jazz Club and operated under this name for approximately 18 years when the management committee began to question whether the regional name of ‘North Queensland’ that did not clearly inform people where the jazz club was actually based was not assisting new people to locate the club. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this age of electronic searches to find recreational activities, it was felt that most new residents and people travelling through Townsville who were searching for jazz venues would include&nbsp;<em>jazz</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Townsville&nbsp;</em>in their search regardless of any other keywords that they may use in their search. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 2011 Annual General Meeting a proposal was made to change the name of the club to Townsville Jazz Club Inc. to better reflect the physical location of the club. This motion was passed and the official change of name took place on 11 January 2012.</p>

<h3>2012 – A year of change and growth</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The club’s website that had been operating since 2006 was changed to reflect the new name and a Townsville Jazz Club Inc. facebook page was established on 21 January 2012.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday 24th&nbsp;June 2012 more than half the club’s members were present for the launch of the new Townsville Jazz Club Inc. logo featuring Neville Minon. &nbsp;This was a memorable night when we paid tribute to Nev for his 62 years of service to both jazz and brass band music. &nbsp;With such a distinguished musical career I don’t think anyone would begrudge Nev the honour of gracing the Townsville Jazz Club logo. &nbsp;It was clear that Nev was very touched by the occasion and he and his wife Christine were delighted with the image that was created through Bob Spillane’s photography and the artistry of Katrina Cataldo at Townprint. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time of the AGM in November 2012 the club had increased its non-member attendance by 69% over the previous year which the committee agreed was heavily influenced by the combination of the change of name and a concerted effort to promote the club through electronic media.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Townsville Jazz Club has continued to shape its program to reflect the style of jazz that attracts the majority of its members (mostly swing and trad jazz), lots of theme nights with patrons encouraged to dress in the fashions of that era, with occasional evenings of modern jazz. &nbsp;The club still encourages bands to play jazz that people can dance to as the most of the members either like to dance or are happy to watch other people dancing whilst still enjoying the music from their chair. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A further development for the club was the introduction of a Facebook page in 2013. This has been steadily expanding people’s awareness of the Townsville Jazz Club and has helped to encourage new people to attend. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we begin the 2015 jazz year with the Opening Night being held on 8th&nbsp;February, the Townsville Jazz Club has a well-planned program for the year, a hard-working dedicated committee and a membership base that loves jazz and fully support their local musicians. &nbsp;What more could a club want...</p>

<h3>1997 – 2008 North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc. was a not a NQ Jazz Club program and operated independently, there was a positive rapport between the two organizations and a willingness by the NQ Jazz Club’s committee to support the aim of Junior Jazz. It is therefore appropriate that Junior Jazz be given the recognition it deserves on the NQ Jazz Club website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Junior Jazz concept was initiated by Brian Lane who was then ably supported by jazz musicians<br>Les Nicholson, Peter Martin and Bob Passmore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 1997 to 2007 Junior Jazz provided an annual opportunity for high school jazz bands to perform before an audience, including a panel of professional jazz musicians, and to be adjudicated on their performance. This was not a competition but an assessment of each band’s performance against several criteria with feedback given personally to each band leader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Junior Jazz started this was perhaps the only opportunity for school bands to demonstrate their interest, understanding and competence in the jazz genre and enthusiasm to take part was very high. One year a record 17 schools took part including bands travelling from Mackay, Charters Towers, Ayr and Ingham as well as several from Townsville. This fantastic participation rate was in no doubt due to the concerted liaison with schools conducted by Junior Jazz President, Brian Lane. &nbsp;As the school music programs gained momentum, students had multiple performance options and Junior Jazz numbers declined until the organisers decided to wind up the North Queensland Junior Jazz Festival Organization Inc. in 2008. The Directors of Junior Jazz unanimously voted to disperse the remaining Junior Jazz funds to &nbsp;the NQ Jazz Club Inc. subject to the terms and conditions listed in a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 25th July 2008. The sum of $2,412.50 was transferred to the NQ Jazz Club on 28th July 2008 and has been used in accordance with the Memorandum and reported in the Treasurer’s Reports each year since that time.</p>

<h3>2009 Step OUT- Step UP: a developmental jazz program</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In January 2009, the North Queensland Jazz Club received a grant from the RADF (Regional Arts Development Fund) through the Townsville City Council, to conduct Step OUT – Step UP: a program to take emerging jazz musicians and singers&nbsp;out&nbsp;of the classroom and&nbsp;up&nbsp;onto the stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept is to assist musicians and singers to Step OUT of the school systems or the non-professional playing arena and have them Step UP to playing in front of fee-paying audiences. There is a world of difference between playing with school bands or non-professional groups and the nuances of performing with professionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of competent, professional jazz players in Townsville is small and this program is designed to increase the city’s jazz-playing personnel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Auditions were completed in February and the successful applicants were introduced to NQ Jazz Club members and guests on Sunday 8 March 2009. On this night, Counterpoint was the featured band, led by Bob Passmore and the line-up included the mentors from the Step OUT – Step UP program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mentors were Vicki Salisbury (vocals), David Salisbury (saxophone), Larry Thomson (piano) and Les Nicholson (trumpet).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next eight months these leading Townsville jazz musicians mentored and trained the 12 successful applicants in the art of singing and playing jazz. As well as attending workshops in improvisation and stagecraft the participants in the program obtained valuable playing experience by sitting in with local jazz bands at professional performances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The participants performed with several different bands at NQ Jazz Club during the course of the year which allowed club members and guests the opportunity to see these artists from their performance with Counterpoint at the beginning of the program and watch their progress throughout the year. These keen young musicians also played at the Picnic Bay Life Savers Sunday jazz session and other venues, gaining experience with a variety of jazz bands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Step OUT – Step UP culminated in a special jazz night at the NQ Jazz Club on 8 November 2009 when the program participants played and sang as STEPPING OUT – a newly developed jazz band with its own unique sound, supported by All the President’s Men and their leading lady, Vick Salisbury.</p>

<h3>Further development of youth in Jazz - TEEN JAZZ</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NQ Jazz Club continues to support young emerging jazz vocalists and musicians through providing regular opportunities for them to perform at the club and in some instances arranging workshops to enhance their understanding and appreciation of jazz as well as their capacity to deliver a true jazz performance. This developmental focus is critical if the club is to continue into the future. One club night, some of the regular jazz musicians Les Nicholson, Bob Passmore and John Ruffle, made the observation that as their average age was around 60 years, they had better do something to ensure that at least some of the next generation of musicians developed a love for jazz and could, in time, fill their shoes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This need to provide for the future of jazz had been recognised by another group of jazz enthusiasts who in 1997 had formed North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc. which continued to provide an annual adjudication of high school jazz bands from 1997 to 2007. The NQ Jazz Club was fortunate to accept funds from the disbanded Junior Jazz organisation in July 2008 on the proviso that this money would be used specifically to support the development of young jazz artists. The distribution of these funds is still being shown in the NQ Jazz Club Inc. financial reports in 2011 and will continue in 2012.</p>

<h3>2011 – Recognising and Rewarding Emerging Musical Talent in the Jazz Genre</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The focus of the 2011 Teen Jazz program was the opportunity for interested schools to participate in a performance that would be adjudicated by a panel of professional jazz artists. The aim of this adjudicated performance is to recognise and reward jazz bands and individual jazz musicians who demonstrate outstanding talent. &nbsp;Recognition would be through opportunities for the best band and best emerging student artists to play at NQ Jazz Club with jazz professionals and possibly at other venues such as the Palmer Street Jazz Festival and The Great Tropical Jazz Party on Magnetic Island. It also offers a great opportunity to be ‘spotted’ by the section leaders of Stokes Nicholson Big Band (currently celebrating its 21st&nbsp;year which is a remarkable milestone for any band!) who are looking to select one new young jazz musician for each section of the big band to ensure the future of this great band.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reward is the award of bursaries to assist with further musical development of the best group and individual jazz performers and the runner-up in each of these sections. The $2000 for these cash incentives was drawn from the money gifted to the NQ Jazz Club by the North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc. when it disbanded in 2008 and a $100 gift voucher donated by The Keyboard Shop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although not a committee member in 2011, Bill Kennedy volunteered his time to co-ordinate the Teen Jazz sub-committee and Bob Passmore contributed a tireless effort ensuring bands were well set up with sound equipment. The professional musicians who gave their time to adjudicate were Vicki and David Salisbury and Les Nicholson. &nbsp;Due to competing demands experienced by high school music students only three schools indicated interest in participating – Cathedral School Stage Band, Saint Margaret Mary’s Jazz Vocal Ensemble and Kirwan High Big Band. Due to time restrictions it was decided that the adjudication would take place at Palmer Street Jazz Festival on Sunday 14th&nbsp;August.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Most Accomplished Group Award of $500 was taken out by Cathedral School Stage Band, the runner-up being Kirwan High Big Band ($250). The Most Accomplished Soloist title was awarded to Oliver Bellwood from Cathedral ($250) and the runner-up title was shared by the soloists from St Margaret Mary’s ($100).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a very enjoyable afternoon with all three participating schools being invited to play at NQ Jazz Club by the end of November. St. Margaret Mary’s Jazz Vocal Ensemble appeared on 9th&nbsp;October; Cathedral School Stage Band on 23rd&nbsp;October and Kirwan High Big Band on 13 November and each school was given a very warm reception by a supportive jazz club audience and several school students joined the professionals in the sit-in bracket on their night. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cathedral School is to be particularly congratulated as it has developed incredibly well over the past 12 months. Some of our members may recall that when Cathedral played for us in March last year it was still quite an inexperienced band that played a fairly short set rather than pushing young musicians beyond their capacity at that time. What a difference a year of good coaching and lots of individual practice can make! And just look at the personality of their trumpet player and vocalist, Oliver Bellwood! This significant development by a relatively new jazz band precisely fits the aim of our Teen Jazz program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shall we see an even stronger performance by one of this year’s bands or perhaps the emergence of another youth band in 2012?</p>

<h3><strong>2010 – Performance and Intrastate Jazz Interaction</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the high school music departments showed very limited interest in participating on the Teen Jazz Stage at the 2010 Palmer Street Jazz Festival, the youth participation at the NQ Jazz Club was as active as in previous years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in 2010 the Cathedral School expressed an interest in bringing their recently formed Stage Band to perform at the club and agreed on Sunday 13th&nbsp;March. The jazz club patrons take great delight in providing a very supportive environment for young musicians just starting out on their jazz journey to perform a small repertoire to give them the confidence to return as they gain more experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August was an exciting month with the visit to the NQ Jazz Club by Beaudesert State High School Big Band. The Beaudesert band had organised a music excursion leaving Brisbane on 5th&nbsp;August to Cairns where they had a workshop with the Hotshots Big Band and some schools, then back down the coast to Townsville to appear at the jazz club and attend a workshop with 1 RAR Army Band then travelling on to Rockhampton, Bundaberg and Toowoomba before arriving home on the 12th. The tour combined sight-seeing, a Cowboys vs Broncos game, jazz workshops with school bands and various professional musicians as well the chance to play for a discerning jazz audience at NQ Jazz Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Beaudesert Big Band and Kirwan High Big Band played at the club on 8th&nbsp;August to a very receptive audience, many of whom were motivated to contribute positive comments for the September Newsletter. Another member took the time to phone the Beaudesert State High School Principal to compliment the school on the musicianship and manners of their touring students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following Sunday was the final day of the 2010 Palmer Street Jazz Festival and it had been hoped that the NQ Jazz Club would host several school bands on the Teen Jazz Stage. However it was disappointing that only Townsville Grammar Big Band was available to play. This band was well received by a small crowd which unfortunately only grew in numbers just as they were completing their performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On 10th&nbsp;October the last of the Teen Jazz performances took place for 2010 with a strong performance by Townsville Grammar Big Band. Once again the patrons at NQ Jazz Club provided a very supportive atmosphere for a well rehearsed performance.</p>

<h3>Albert Schimmel</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Growing up with trad jazz in Europe I still enjoy this type of music.<br>One can't go past the Dutch Swing College Band but my favourite band is Chris Barber and his Jazzmen. This gives you an indication of the type of program to expect from me.<br>I do play the older bands like Jack Teagarden, Humphrey Lyttelton, Sidney Bechet with a few big bands thrown in. My favourite being Benny Goodman. I have a good selection of Australian trad jazz records from Graeme Bell to the New Melbourne Jazz band.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Maurie Besgrove</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like various types of jazz, especially instrumental, but not very much of the highly technical improvisational playing.<br>I particularly like the modern jazz of Don Burrows, James Morrison and Bob Barnard and their associates and older music of performers such as Dave Brubeck, Kenny Ball and Acker Bilk.<br>Other jazz types I like and present are nostalgia, traditional, Dixie, swing, big bands, Latin, gospel, blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These and other presenters of great jazz invite you to tune in every Tuesday and Thursday night<br>8.00 – 10.00 pm. for great jazz</p>
